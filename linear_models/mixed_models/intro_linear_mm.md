I like Shravan Vasishth's lectures on linear mixed models ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKdl_phjEXA&ab_channel=ShravanVasishth) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmPouLbvfXI&ab_channel=ShravanVasishth)) as a primer/introduction to the intuition and application of linear mixed models.  
- worth rewatching and taking notes
